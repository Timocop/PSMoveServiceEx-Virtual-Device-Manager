# PSMoveServiceEx - Virtual Device Manager
A virtual device manager for PSMoveServiceEx.
With this program you can control any virtual device in PSMoveServiceEx and even use them in SteamVR or other services!

 ## ℹ️  Important Notice

 > ### ℹ️ Virtual Device Manager will slowly replace PSMoveService VRBridge!
 > **With Virtual Device Manager, you can use your PSMove controller as a controller, HMD 6-DoF replacement, or full-body solution!**
**In the future more devices will be supported.**

 > ### ⚠️ The SteamVR driver is only compatible with [``PSMoveSerivceEx v0.19.1``](https://github.com/Timocop/PSMoveServiceEx/releases) and higher!
 > **Using this version on an older PSMoveServiceEx version can cause tracking problems or some features might not work properly!**

 > ### ⚠️ Anti-Virus false positives when installing LibUSB drivers!
 > **Because Playstation Eyes and PlayStation VR need a special driver for Windows, you need to install an open-source unsigned driver called [libusb](https://github.com/pbatard/libwdi). Because the driver is unsigned, some Anti-Virus vendors might see this as a malicious act and flag Virtual Device Manager while installing the driver. This is a false positive! Please whitelist the Virtual Device Manager folder to avoid this problem!**

## ℹ️ Known Issues and Limitations
- Webcams in ``Virtual Trackers`` are still in prototyping phase. There might be tracking issues when using Webcams because every Webcam is different.

- Currently only PSmove controllers are supported for ``Virtual Motion Tracker`` trackers.
*(DualShock4, Navi controllers, gamepads and other third party devices will be added in the future)*
