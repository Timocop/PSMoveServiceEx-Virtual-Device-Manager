# PSMoveServiceEx - Virtual Device Manager
A virtual device manager for PSMoveServiceEx.
With this program you can control any virtual device in PSMoveServiceEx and even use them in SteamVR or other services!

## Known Issues and Limitations
 - When running OSC Server in ``Virtual Motion Tracker`` before launching SteamVR, some trackers might not load correctly when SteamVR loads. Please start OSC Server only when SteamVR is fully loaded. Will be fixed in the future.

 - Webcams in ``Virtual Trackers`` are still in prototyping phase. There might be tracking issues when using Webcams because every Webcam is different.
 
 - Left and Right Controller roles seem to behave inconsistently. More testing is required.
 
 - Currently only PSmove controllers are supported for ``Virtual Motion Tracker`` trackers.
 *(DualShock4, Navi controllers, gamepads and other third party devices will be added in the future)*
 
 - Installing Playstation Eye Drivers via Virtual Device Manager does not work on Windows 10 please use Zadig instead.
**Zadig is incompatible with Windows 11!**
